I've made a few video on Maths
* ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ [Math in pills](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLW_mrnzxmSo-Q841ZuBDxcIHHX4iGZkX) (English)
* ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ [Math pillole](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLW_mrnzxmSp_zuV3OzY_Wksf6_dP-Ifn) (Italian)
* ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹  [LibroMate (la matematica secondo Carlesso)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLW_mrnzxmSofo9gxu_NsWYl9c9NNmjZ6) (Italian)
* [Silly video with my kid](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLW_mrnzxmSpYyZ3zBOuRjNMpVOlSIlzi) (so silly, but they get lots of positive votes)

## Book

I've also started writing a Book of maths a few years back, when in Calabria with no internet, and I just wanted to dump
memoery and ideas in a LateX document, and here's the output:

* My book on github: [palladius/libromate](https://github.com/palladius/libromate) Mathematical Analysis in LaTEX:

Numbers, Derivation/Limits/Integrals, Taylor, the usual stuff, but in Italian, sorry)

## Podcast

* I'm investigating the idea of starting a podcast.
