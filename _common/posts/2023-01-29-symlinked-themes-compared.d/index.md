I tried many modules this weekend. Note that different themes have different words and key/vals in the above stanza so I better not confuse them.
For instance, this page has a `featured_image` which only works with Ananke, and a `image` which probably works with other themes.

What I've tried so far:

## Symlinking across all pages.

* so far only tried one - definitely golang won't notice the changed symlinked file.
* Notice that STACK is currently in a DIFFEERENT place. Let me move it for a second.

## My Hugo websites I've tried so far

All the code is in different directories of my GH repo: https://github.com/palladius/ricc.rocks/

| Theme + PermaCompare | Website     | Stars |  Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ---- |
| Bootstrap   | [hugo-bootstrap-ricc-rocks](https://hugo-bootstrap-ricc-rocks.netlify.app/) | ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Just amazing |
| Stack       | [hugo-stack.ricc.rocks](https://hugo-stack.ricc.rocks) |‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | played A LOT with it. Note its in a different repo |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ----  |
| [üôâ](https://ricc-zzo.netlify.app/en/posts/riccardo/prova-zzo/) ZZO         | [ricc-zzo.netlify.app)](https://ricc-zzo.netlify.app/en/) | ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Ha le icone come le voglio io, molto giocoso, ma pieno di feature splendide. Mi piace un tot!  |

(*) Permacompare: permalink in prod to the comparison page :)

* **PaperMod**: it works! https://papermod.ricc.rocks	 not explored much yet. Comparison page: https://papermod.ricc.rocks/posts/papermod-analysis-page/  [üôâ](https://ricc.rocks/posts/papermod-analysis-page/) PaperMod |‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è   | Super sleek. Essential but damn, so good in its essence! |
* **Stack**: First, has [math](https://dev.stack.jimmycai.com/p/math-typesetting/). https://hugo-stack.ricc.rocks  then I just love it!
* **Bootstrap**: https://hugo-bootstrap-ricc-rocks.netlify.app/
* üöß [WIP] **Tranquilpeak**.  https://tranquilpeak.netlify.app/ Has Math
* üöß [WIP] **ZZO**. https://ricc-zzo.netlify.app/en/

Lost the battle:

* **Coder**: Naah, too simple for me.
* Ananke. Too simple - https://hugo-ananke.netlify.app/

## Photo Albums

* Only XXX seems to have decent photo albums. However, people are saying "i wish your theme was as good as Photoswipe" so I believe I might just get [**PhotoSwipe**](https://photoswipe.com/) to work with anything else: see [HugoPhotoSwipe](https://github.com/GjjvdBurg/HugoPhotoSwipe).
* maybe check https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery but i dont think its worht it. (505 ‚≠êÔ∏è).
* Or just code it (I wish it was Ruby and not Golang): https://hugocodex.org/add-ons/image-gallery/
* or use this [awesome library](https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery): demo in https://matze.rocks/images/#gallery-filter=Landscape

# Old stuff

## PaperMod

I spent little time so far - but its just my fault, not his :)

Docs: https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/

NEUTRAL:

* supports [many icons](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-icons/#social-icons), but unsure how to use them
* [Supports Maths](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/math-typesetting/), but unsure on how to make it work/
* emoji are nice, once enaled you can do üôà :see_no_evil: üôâ :hear_no_evil: üôä :speak_no_evil:

BAD üò©:

* too simple. Doesnt have something about me as a blogger, its just a pure (sleek) container for news. Nothing about Riccardo, just my articles.


## Ananke ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9c6fdacc-6b9f-4908-b3e5-57f1dc2b8f50/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hugo-ananke/deploys)
Old:
* [hugo-ananke.netlify.app](https://hugo-ananke.netlify.app)
* Historically the first ive tried. Havent explored much

GOOD üòç:

* TODO

BAD üò©:

* **too simple**. Eg, contact form is amongst posts (seriously?)
* no image gallery Im afraid


## TranquilPeak

![image](tranquilpeak-showcase.png)

* GH: https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme
* 861 stars / 515 forks
* DemoSite:
* license: GPL
* install: https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/blob/master/docs/user.md

How to sue the image btag (finally!): https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/blob/master/docs/user.md#image


PLUS

* nice graphics
* built in galleries

MINUS

* says FS doesnt support symlinks for images. But it does support them for posts
* Fishy in content/posts/ organization. If I move content in or out dirs, it disappears. Weird. (Maybe there's a good reason for it, but seems like a bug wrt to other themes where you can move things accross EVERYTHING within content/ )
