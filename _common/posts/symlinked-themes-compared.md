I tried many modules this weekend. Let's see how [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) goes.

* seems SUPER simple. So featureless wrt to others, but also so easier to use.
* Uses FormSpree for contact form [contact](/posts/contact). Works like a charm.
* images. See [Scuba diving](/posts/first-scuba/) page to see if it works.

What I've tried so far:

## Symlinking across all pages.

* so far only tried one - definitely golang won't notice the changed symlinked file.
*
## My Hugo websites I've tried so far

All the code is in different directories of my GH repo: https://github.com/palladius/ricc.rocks/

| Theme  | Website     | Stars | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Ananke      | [hugo-ananke.netlify.app](https://hugo-ananke.netlify.app)        | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ | Historically the first ive tried. Havent explored much |
| PaperMod    | [ricc.rocks](https://ricc.rocks/) |⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️      | Very little effort done here |
| Stack       | [hugo-stack.ricc.rocks](https://hugo-stack.ricc.rocks) |⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | played A LOT with it |
| Bootstrap   | [hugo-bootstrap-ricc-rocks](https://hugo-bootstrap-ricc-rocks.netlify.app/) | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | played a lot |


* **PaperMod**: it works! https://ricc.rocks/ not explored much yet
* **Stack**: First, has [math](https://dev.stack.jimmycai.com/p/math-typesetting/). https://hugo-stack.ricc.rocks  then I just love it!
* **Bootstrap**: https://hugo-bootstrap-ricc-rocks.netlify.app/
* **Coder**: Naah, too simple for me.

## Photo Albums

* Only XXX seems to have decent photo albums. However, people are saying "i wish your theme was as good as Photoswipe" so I believe I might just get [**PhotoSwipe**](https://photoswipe.com/) to work with anything else: see [HugoPhotoSwipe](https://github.com/GjjvdBurg/HugoPhotoSwipe).
* maybe check https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery but i dont think its worht it. (505 ⭐️).
* Or just code it (I wish it was Ruby and not Golang): https://hugocodex.org/add-ons/image-gallery/
* or use this [awesome library](https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery): demo in https://matze.rocks/images/#gallery-filter=Landscape


## Ananke

GOOD 😍:

* TODO

BAD 😩:

* **too simple**. Eg, contact form is amongst posts (seriously?)

## PaperMod

I spent little time so far - but its just my fault, not his :)

Docs: https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/

NEUTRAL:

* supports [many icons](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-icons/#social-icons), but unsure how to use them
* [Supports Maths](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/math-typesetting/), but unsure on how to make it work/
* emoji are nice, once enaled you can do 🙈 :see_no_evil: 🙉 :hear_no_evil: 🙊 :speak_no_evil:
