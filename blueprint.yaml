  description_long: The project includes multiple Hugo installations, each using a
    different theme. These themes are being evaluated for their look and feel, as
    well as their functionalities. Some of the themes include Bootstrap, Stack, Papermod,
    Ananke, Coder, Tranquilpeak, and ZZO. The goal is to port the personal website
    to one of these Hugo themes.

    TODO(ricc): consider breaking this down into monorepo -> multiple sub projects.
