*TODO(Ricc): This is currently under `posts/`. You ned to add the logic to copy this under ZZO/{LANG}/about/ . Maybe you could add a carlessian-geminocks-target-folder but it might add too much to complexity.*

Hi! I'm Riccardo, and I go by <tt>Palladius</tt> or just Ricc.

## Work

![Riccardo innaturally handsome at his wedding](image.png)

I'm Developer Advocate for [Google Cloud](http://cloud.google.com/). This blog has a bit of personal and work-related stuff: from sports to travel, family and technology.

Been in Google for 11 years, and I've never found a way to write up all this amazing journey. It has to have fruitful content, italian drama and cool pics. The latter is taking me time to write. Some of my

* Linkedin: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardocarlesso/>
* Google official page: <https://cloud.google.com/developers/advocates/riccardo-carlesso>

I speak about SRE, Operations, Culture at Google, GenAI, and Ruby.

## Personal

I'm Italian, except I'm mostly on time. I've lived in Italy 32 years, then moved to Ireland (2008), and in 2011 I moved to Switzerland where I currently live with my kind and caring wife Kate and two amazing kids: *AJ* and *Sebowski*. You can find us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/palladius/), or in the [family gallery](/en/gallery/riccardo-family/).

Of course, I live in Switzerland.

## Hobbies

To quote Graham, *I used to have hobbies, now I have kids*. My hobbies used to be around sport, music, travel, nerdiness and include:

* **Piano** playing (mostly playing Genesis of Peter Gabriel era, or Dream Theater)
* Doing **triathlons** (I completed two full **Ironman**, both in Zurich, and 5-6 half-distance around EMEA).
* Playing **Magic the Gathering** (on Arena or with my kids, with disastrous effects - but at least Ale is learning to count to 20!)
* **Cooking** with my Thermomix (they say it's cheating). And blogging about American cooking Italian stuff.
* **Travel**. I hold a spreadsheet of countries visited for me and my buddy Andrea. Currently around 61. Andrea hates me since I went on a cruise around caribbeans and got +5 in a week.
* **Computers**. I love Ruby on Rails, Linux, bash scripting and mixing family with my coding. Dont believe me?
  * See [aj-alphabet-dev.palladi.us](http://aj-alphabet-dev.palladi.us/alfabeto?alphabet=it&cells_per_row=6&locale=en&predilige=portrait) on how to teach alphabet letters to your kids with known images.
  * See ðŸš§ [PuffinTours](https://puffintours-prod-rjjr63dzrq-ew.a.run.app/) ðŸš§ where I store our trips (WIP) and ability for my wife to vote for me. (She calls me puffin).

## This site


{{< boxmd >}}
This site is built in Hugo (of course I'd prefer Jekyll, but I followed the lead from my colleagues) with [ZZO](https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo) ([docs](https://zzo-docs.vercel.app/zzo)). If you wonder why I chose this, it was a couple of weekends trying out 5 differnt things. The lessons learnt are here:
{{< /boxmd >}}

Lessons learnt:

* <https://github.com/palladius/ricc.rocks>. Readme contains links to all alternative sites, like Ananke,
  Boostrap, Stack, Papermod, and Coder. Stack was my wife's favorite, Bootstrap was my favorite, until I found out it had a smissing thing which I can't remember. So I went for ZZO, which reminds me of the Italian **zzo vuoi?**, which is fun.

Alternative sites:
