TODO embed local video:  2023-02-03 Capriola as a Service.mp4

* [Silly video with my kid](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLW_mrnzxmSpYyZ3zBOuRjNMpVOlSIlzi) (so silly, but they get lots of positive votes)

## Book

* My book on github: [palladius/libromate](https://github.com/palladius/libromate) Mathematical Analysis in LaTEX:

## Podcast

* I'm investigating the idea of starting a podcast.
