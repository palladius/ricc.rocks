I tried many modules this weekend. Let's see how [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) goes.

* seems SUPER simple. So featureless wrt to others, but also so easier to use.
* Uses FormSpree for contact form [contact]. Works like a charm.
* images. See [/posts/first-scuba/](Scuba diving) <a href="/posts/first-scuba/">Scuba2</a> page to see if it works.
