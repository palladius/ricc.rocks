## Why Madeira in February?

I married a saint woman (Kate) who from time to time allows me to travel solo for a week while her family comes to
Zurich and help with kids. This year it happened in February: too early to cycle in Mallorca, so I asked my friend Mike
for a nice place to go and he suggested Madeira.

I told my friends on Xmas and my friend Riccardo (yep, you're not seeing double yet, it's just another Riccardo, 'Ridge').

## Saturday: just a look around

I land around 11 and I'm immediately welcomed by a Pastel de Nata at the local bar (geniusly located between the plane and the luggage claim), and I see publicity of "Blandey's wine tasting". It will be my next quest to involve Ridge into wine tasting and bringing home some bottles of Madeiras "porto" (it's not porto! Just to make it easy for you, it's fortified wine with acidity and oxidized, so it survives opening for years, differently from porto which needs be consumed within weeks from opening).

As sopon as I make it to the hotel, I go get my bike at [Happy Bikes](https://www.happybikes.pt/) (conveniently 200m from the hotel). The super gentle owner helps me bringing Ridge bike to my hotel while I bring mine.
I get a enduro bike (75eur), as Ridge wants to save and Happy Bikes only have one cheap MTB (45e).
The giroscopic saddle is a new thing to me, and I totally get in love with it!

Next step, I go to visit [Blandy's](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blandy's+Wine+Lodge+(former+Adegas+de+S%C3%A3o+Francisco)/@32.6449894,-16.9240557,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0xc6060086c82670f:0xc55073cc6045c67!8m2!3d32.6478698!4d-16.9106236!16s%2Fg%2F1q5bprx89) to find a congenial visit time for Ridge an I on Monday or Tuesday.

Finally I go to eat at **[Terra](https://www.google.com/maps/place/TERRA+-+Food+Concept/@32.6489523,-16.9112022,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0xc606167302d50ed:0xb4be6622c761d352!8m2!3d32.6489523!4d-16.9090135!16s%2Fg%2F11rvdjk0jg)**'s, the only super-expensive restaurant in Madeira, but also so bloody worht it :) Check pics on my my [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Coje6JRsBGh/).




## Sunday: muddy mountain-biking

We go with Helvio and Helder from [madeiraaltitude](https://madeiraaltitude.com/) (they did a great job, so i feel like giving them some free publicity if you dont mind). Weather is total crap.

## Mon: go west!

## Tue: go up!

## Wed: lonely, rainy east-side

Ridge left early this morning, leaving me alone with a fully charged ebike.

Today I take thr 70km ride east to the airport; it's expected to rain after 13:00 so I have 3+ hours of dry ride.

The views are absolutely majestic, but after 30m it starts raining and it's getting less fun.

So I get to this amazing cliff, and at my third shower I decide to go back to the hotel and call it a day. I'm not hugely into rain, particularly in a terrain I dont know, a bike I dont know, too much
to test for a wet terrain with 15% descents.

I take the afternoon off, bring back my 3 bottle sof Madeira fortified wine to the shop so they bring them to the airport and I can collect the wine after security (big *bazza*!).
I then bring back my e-bike to [Happy Bikes](https://www.happybikes.pt/). I have to say, they
really did a great job!

## Thu: TODO
