1. A cheerful robot superhero with "Gemini CLI" and "Antigravity" logos on its chest, effortlessly untangling a chaotic network of pipes, servers, and code snippets, all while a small, worried cloud (representing Netlify) looks on with relief. The style should be modern, vibrant, and slightly cartoonish.
2. A sophisticated AI assistant, represented by glowing data streams and holographic interfaces, meticulously deploying a complex software update, with a human SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) enjoying a cup of coffee in the background, looking calm and confident. The style should be futuristic and sleek.
3. A whimsical robot wearing a hard hat labeled "SRE" is joyfully debugging a computer screen displaying various code errors and network issues. Colorful thought bubbles around its head show successful solutions and happy emojis. The overall mood should be lighthearted and optimistic.
4. A clean and futuristic command center dashboard with prominent "Gemini CLI" and "Antigravity" interfaces, all systems showing "GREEN" and "OPERATIONAL". In the background, a small, stylized cloud icon (Netlify) is smiling, indicating successful builds and deployments. The style should be minimalist and high-tech.
