Everyone knows GenAI is good for coding. Even [Linus is vibecoding with Antigravity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46569587) now!

However, **how AI can help SREs and Operators is still up for debate**.

I'm at work when my friend Elia from the Rubycon team tells me: *"Riccardo, Netlify can't update our site anymore!"* 

Luckily, the site is not down, it's just stuck! 


![Antigravity + Gemini CLI FTW!](header.png)

In this article, we'll see how Antigravity can help:

1. Troubleshoot Netlify build issues, quite brilliantly.
2. Implement fixes and document changes for future reuse.

![The issue #58](image.png)

TODO(ricc): **taglia meglio img**

The issue: https://github.com/palladius/rubycon.it/issues/58 

Sounds familiar? Luckily I have **Antigravity**, **Gemini CLI**, and a number of tools at my disposal to right the wrong! Time to put my Ops hat on and fix this. So let's Start With...

```
$ cd ~/git/rubycon.it/
$ antigravity .
```

<figure style="margin: 1.5rem auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="image-1.png" alt="Help me troubleshoot this..." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
  <figcaption style="width: 80%; margin: 0.5rem auto 0; font-style: italic; color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;">
    <strong>Fig 1</strong>: You'll never guess my nationality from my <tt>PS1</tt>..

</figure>



## Antigravity Keeps Me in the Loop

Antigravity is great at keeping me in the loop, and surviving software crashes and computer reboots.

I write lazily (I could be a CEO now!) on the right side of Antigravity:

> Help me troubleshoot this: https://github.com/palladius/rubycon.it/issues/58


<figure style="margin: 1.5rem auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="image-2.png" alt="Help me troubleshoot this..." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
  <figcaption style="width: 80%; margin: 0.5rem auto 0; font-style: italic; color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;">
    <strong>Fig HTML</strong>: Asking Antigravity to analyze the GitHub issue - notice how I can just paste the URL and it fetches the context automatically!
  </figcaption>
</figure>

{{< figure 
    src="image-2.png" 
    alt="Help me troubleshoot this..." 
    caption="  **Fig Hugo**: Asking Antigravity to analyze the GitHub issue - notice how I can just paste the URL and it fetches the context automatically!  " 
    width="100%"
    class="narrow-caption"
>}}

After some thinking, Antigravity analyzes the issue, identifies the problem, and proposes a fix:

<!-- ## Fixing the Issue -->

Once the fix is ready, I simply tell Antigravity:

> Comment on issue 58 with: 1. what the problem was, 2. what your fix was. Ensure you sign yourself as Antigravity.

**Bham!** The comment is posted automatically.

Then:

> "ok git commit with gitmoji and push now!"

And we're done! The fix is deployed.

## Bonus: Adding a Sponsor

Meanwhile, a sponsor has paid us and wants their logo to be represented on our website! 

1. I file a GitHub issue: https://github.com/palladius/rubycon.it/issues/59 with a ZIP of their logo.
2. I tell Antigravity to take it from there. 
3. **4 minutes later**, the commit is done and online.
4. **1 minute later**, the change is documented on GitHub and the issue is closed. WOW!

![sponsor page updated with latest sponsor](image-12.png)

### Wait a Minute... Sponsor asks for a change

The sponsor (Welaika) made a comment on GitHub about the wrong link. I open my Antigravity and:

> welaika made a comment on GH. PTAL at the comment and fix it pls.
> pls leave the LinkedIn link as a comment for future use.

![alt text](image-13.png)

A minute later... fixed!

![GHI fixed](image-14.png)

And we're game! 🎮

## And now lets write a nice post about this..

*(yes, THIS post you're reading!)*

Houston we got a problem: 

![Netlify push is stuck!](image-4.png)

As you can see from this image, Netlify is not updating our site and this article is only visible in localhost! 

Time to ask Antigravity in a new thread (yes, AG is multi threaded)! Let's attach this image and ask it to create an issue, and fix it!

![AG help me here!](image-5.png)

=> https://github.com/palladius/ricc.rocks/issues/2

Now this was more complex, after a bit of back and forth, AG figured it out: 

![alt text](image-6.png)

And indeed... 

![it compiled finally!](image-7.png)
![better screenshot for BUILD on netlify](image-9.png)

it worked, damn GLIBC! :) 

And finally, my article landed online on ricc.rocks, where most likely you're reading it!

## Conclusion (ricc TIODO change this)

This is how AI-assisted operations work in practice. With **Gemini CLI** and **Antigravity**, I can:

1. **Troubleshoot issues** faster by having AI analyze GitHub issues
2. **Implement fixes** with AI assistance
3. **Document changes** automatically
4. **Handle follow-up requests** efficiently

The future of SRE work is here, and it's powered by AI! 🚀
