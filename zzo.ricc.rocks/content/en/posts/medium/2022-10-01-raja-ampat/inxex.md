**My Scuba Diving Experience in Raja Ampat**

A big thanks to my amazing wife ❤️ for letting me take a solo scuba diving trip to Raja Ampat, a true diver's paradise located west of Indonesia!

**Raja Ampat's Beauty**

<!-- Replace with actual image (check ZZO documentation for image syntax) -->

I encountered some incredible marine life, including a rare animal facing extinction in the coming decades. I also spotted a beautiful sea turtle while diving near Sauwandarek village.

**Life on Wai Island**

This is my temporary home on Wai Island, a beautiful spot to explore.

**A Day in Paradise**

My typical day started with the sunrise around 5 am. Electricity wouldn't kick in until 5:30 am, so I enjoyed the quiet mornings soaking in the view.

**The Coding Bug Bites**

After a morning of diving, I found myself drawn to coding.  I stumbled upon the `palladius/marinelife-crawler.git` project and it sparked an idea: a Ruby on Rails app to scrape marine life information!

**Diving Adventures**

Check out Riccardo greeting this Wobbegong!

**Exploring Wai Island**

Exploring the stunning Wai Island with Congee by my side. PiaynemoPyaynemo is a must-visit for any Raja Ampat trip!

**Post-Trip Ponderings**

My photos turned out a bit blue! Here's my dilemma:

* **Option 1: AquaColorFix App** - This $20 app seems like a quick fix: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aquacolorfix-photo-video/id1579618383
* **Option 2: Red Lens & Lighting** - Invest in a red lens filter and lighting setup (more expensive, but potentially versatile).

Software editing might be the more cost-effective solution for this trip, but the red lens setup could be useful in the future.
