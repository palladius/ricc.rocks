## context

I'm a developer advocate called Riccardo and I write blogs on behalf of Google Cloud.
We're launching in 2 days a new program called `gemini-cli`, which allows to call Gemini (yes, thats you!) from CLI.
I need to create an article for launch, and I wrote something MUCH bigger which I need to synthesize while making it nice and engaging.

## task

In `output.md` you can find a markdown containing a huge log of actions that i took to write a beautiful article on a new product we are launching
called  `gemini-cli`.

While it started as an article, note that it became super bloated with a lot of screenshots, and braindumps.

I want to make an article out of this, with most of the images I laboriously created, possibly highlighting the evolution of my portfolio app.

Please do the following:

1. create a `gemini_index.md` which has a decent size for a technical article.
   1. Keep images, as much as you can, as you see fit.
2. It needs to contain:
   1. The evolution of my app, from thoughts to implementation. The app is just the story baseline, of course, its NOT the message I want to get across.
   2. Some the wow moments with Gemini CLI, particularly when the feedback loop was self-sustained.
   3. Riccardo's style. Whenever you find some part of the doc where I write with decent verve just keep it AS IS (eg, at the beginning). When it feels like a blurb, just do your job of summarizing while keeping Riccardo style.
3. Create a `AI_REASONING.md` where you put your thinking, like "I'm removing this, or rephrasing this". Remember, whatever you LLM write in chat will be outlived by this beautiful MD so make it nice and *essential*; meaning: do NOT skip anything relevant but dont be too verbose: less is more.
   1. Load `AI_REASONING.md` when you start chatting with me.

## Content

* Ensure there the small "API route regression: time for a test!" part is present: both the narrative and the three images are amazing and show the ability for the test.
* Ensure the CTA both on bottom and above: How do the public get access to Gemini CLI upon launch?
via either `npm install @google/gemini-cli` or `npx @google/gemini-cli`.
