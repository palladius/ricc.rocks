I felel in love with MJ.

* Some tips: https://www.wired.it/article/come-usare-midjourney/

* See my gallery in this website: https://ricc.rocks/en/gallery/midjourney/
* See my MJ page: https://www.midjourney.com/app/users/6f8c6312-ed0d-479f-b236-efbbffbb9823/

## What it's good for

* amazing at merging/bending different concepts and giving you an artistic view of something you know. Example: a mermaid chair: https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_A_mermaid_chair_with_a_fish_fin_design._Purple__21a14287-9793-454d-958d-9c83e17e9898.png
* great at styling things (style of Caravaggio, Pixar, ...).  Amazing effects: Lego-fication, minecraft-fication, niji, manga, Pixar, ...
  See [Donald Trump in Leonardo style](https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Donald_Trump_in_the_style_of_Leonardo_10c5f4ea-304e-4f8e-a337-6d462c77e2d7.png),
  or a [statue of Donald](https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Donald_Trump_in_an_ancient_rome_time_posing_as__030c15e0-5006-4018-aa92-9ad674337369.png). Apologies, I just find that man amusing! Or take [Pope Francis smoking a joint with Silent Bob](https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Jay_and_silent_Bob_smoke_marijuana_with_Pope_Fr_e47f97da-316c-4713-87f0-47c142f42256.png) or again
  [Mr Bean with Thanos gloves](https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Mr_Bean_wearing_Thanos_gauntlet_0bc58f64-1a2a-477f-a7dc-018de3712082.png)
  (I know, my creativity is above charts :P).
* Really good with famous characters, real or ficticious. Of course, the more famous the better the model.
  Eg: Trump/Obama/NYC: great, Dragonlance/Raistlin Majere/Bologna: poor. Example: [Barney Stinson with Mother Theresa](https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Barney_Stinson_hitting_on_Mother_Theresa_hyper__2768e3b6-ce99-43b7-ba27-a10932de0c44.png),
* Abstract logos. You can build a website frontend in minutes. Wow.

* Creating fake news. Unfortunately I can pretend Trump is in prison or Milan has been bombarded by Russian forces:

or [Bill Clinton shaking hands to reptilians](https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Bill_Clinton_shaking_hands_with_a_reptilian_mar_eb549a7f-2b7c-40a1-9edd-8623b6868ab9.png), [Berlisconi in heaven with beautiful women](https://ricc.rocks/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Berlusconi_in_heaven_surrounded_by_beautiful_mo_c11c33c8-2e4d-4a05-bf1d-26bf4aec934d.png).

## What it's bad for

* They say its bad for putting FIVE fingers in people. I would say - ask for a portrait ;)
* I note its pretty bad in enumneration: you ask for a band or family of 4 members, it gives you3 or 6. You ask for a
  dragon, a lion, a puffin and a giraffe, and it gets confused, merges some of them. You ask him to get the Pope and Silent
  Bob, it gives you two Silent Bobs dressed like a pope.
* While you can upload your own images, people faces cannot be used yet: you can get Barney Stinson easy peasy but not
  your child face captured with Shrek, for instance. Results are just BAD. But who cares, while i can get [Derek Zoolander painted by Leonardo](http://localhost:1313/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Derek_Zoolander_in_the_style_of_Leonardo_465499df-7c00-42be-9f39-3bbdc0a8803d.png) or [by Caravaggio](http://localhost:1313/gallery/midjourney/PalladiusPacans_Derek_Zoolander_looks_like_Ben_Stiller_in_the_s_ecccee63-c0df-4bd8-a788-d307f8f3fb62.png)!
