I've been in Ziurich for 10 years, so now I can apply for swiss passport (I heard once you do, you get a free gold lingot from a Nazi *caveau*).

Jokes apart, the top complexity here is to pass an exam in German (Swiss German oder Hoch Deutsch, your choice).

This article describes my steps and struggles. Luckily, I have super smart colleagues in Google who helped me. This is my trying to give back :)


# 1. Back to School!

First thing, you need a certificate from one of the enabled schools:

According to [Stadt Zurich official page](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/portal/de/index/politik_u_recht/einbuergerungen/kenntnisse/sprachlicheanforderungen.html) (in German, of course), *All persons applying for naturalization must provide written proof of their German language skills. The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages â€‹â€‹(CEFR) has different levels. For naturalization, all persons must prove German language skills at the following levels:*

* oral (speaking and listening): level B 1;
* written (writing and reading): level A 2;

The schools that provide what you ask are these:

1. [**Goethe Institute**](http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gzb/deindex.html) (hardest)
2. [TELC Ltd](https://www.telc.net/#section-0) - ?
3. [Ã–SD](http://www.osd.at/) (Austrian, Second hardest)
4. [Fide language certificate](http://www.fide-service.ch/)
5. [Digital language test](https://www.digitalersprachtest.ch/)

# 2. The exam

TBD
