I've been in Ziurich for 10 years, so now I can apply for swiss passport (I heard once you do, you get a free gold lingot from a Nazi *caveau*).

Jokes apart, the top complexity here is to pass an exam in German (Swiss German oder Hoch Deutsch, your choice).

This article describes my steps and struggles. Luckily, I have super smart colleagues in Google who helped me. This is my trying to give back :)
