I've been in Ziurich for 10 years, so now I can apply for swiss passport (I heard once you do, you get a free gold lingot from a Nazi *caveau*).

Jokes apart, the top complexity here is to pass an exam in German (Swiss German oder Hoch Deutsch, your choice).

This article describes my steps and struggles. Luckily, I have super smart colleagues in Google who helped me. This is my trying to give back :)


# 1. Back to School!

First thing, you need a certificate from one of the enabled schools:

According to [Stadt Zurich official page](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/portal/de/index/politik_u_recht/einbuergerungen/kenntnisse/sprachlicheanforderungen.html) (in German, of course), *All persons applying for naturalization must provide written proof of their German language skills. The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages â€‹â€‹(CEFR) has different levels. For naturalization, all persons must prove German language skills at the following levels:*

* oral (speaking and listening): level **B1**
* written (writing and reading): level **A2**

The schools that provide what you ask are these:

1. [**Goethe Institute**](http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gzb/deindex.html) (hardest). No location in Switzerland, it seems (?)
2. [TELC Ltd](https://www.telc.net/#section-0) - ?
3. [Ã–SD](http://www.osd.at/) (Austrian, Second hardest)
4. [Fide language certificate](http://www.fide-service.ch/)
5. [Digital language test](https://www.digitalersprachtest.ch/)

Now:
* Goethe doesn't have presence in Switzerland and I hear its the hardest. Ciao.
* TELC has a pre-Christ website with still events from 2013-2014 (wow), still I contected them for more info.
* OST says "Internationally recognized German language exams and certificates for children, young learners and adults", and since it starts with Children I have a feeling I won't be treated like a complete idiot (*how long have you been living in Sweitzerland? What, 10 years? And you still don't speak German?* - followed by a compassion gaze). they do have centers in [Frauenfeld](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Zurich+HB,+Bahnhofplatz,+Zurigo,+Svizzera/Frauenfeld,+Svizzera/@47.550191,8.9002971,13.83z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47900a08cc0e6e41:0xf5c698b65f8c52a7!2m2!1d8.5403226!2d47.3778579!1m5!1m1!1s0x479a922b7ac416d5:0xabd5ea8c4a738dc7!2m2!1d8.8987541!2d47.5535997!3e3) (36m from HB) and [Niederurnen](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Zurich+HB,+Bahnhofplatz,+Zurigo,+Svizzera/8867+Niederurnen,+Svizzera/@47.1837248,8.744133,11.39z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47900a08cc0e6e41:0xf5c698b65f8c52a7!2m2!1d8.5403226!2d47.3778579!1m5!1m1!1s0x479acd0b21f91dfd:0x6eb928b1714053f3!2m2!1d9.0531505!2d47.125507!3e3) (50m from HB). Ok, Frauenfeld wins :) Ok, there's [one](https://www.osd.at/en/take-tests/find-exam-dates/?country=167&tests=00001100000&land=null&stadt=Frauenfeld&datefrom=01.06.2023&dateto=31.08.2023&centernr=null) **B1 exam on June 24th** - should be good! I wrote to the organizer and will tell you more close to the date about https://www.osd.at/en/take-tests/find-exam-dates/pruefung/?tid=29224ZB1

# 2. The B1 exam

TBD

# 3. The Stadt Zurich exam

I've heard a lot of rumors which I'm going to write here:

* It's much easier to get your certificate in Zurich than in small mountain towns where the local shaman vets you and decide if you fit in with the culture (I love fondue, cook [Cuchaule](https://cookidoo.ch/recipes/recipe/fr-CH/r434981) and can pronounce *Cuchicaschli*, and called the police on a noisy neighbour - hello?!?)
