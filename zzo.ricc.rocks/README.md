How to do a gallery in ZZO:

1. Create a folder under `content/en/gallery/`
2. Create a index file under that folder, eg. `content/en/gallery/midjourney/index.md`
3. (optional) Now add an entry under `config/_default/menus.en.yaml`. The gallery will now appearin top right menu
   and respond to link like http://localhost:1313/en/gallery/midjourney/
4. Create a folder where to store all the pics: under ./static/gallery/

Final examples for MJ

*  content/en/gallery/midjourney/ : gallery article.
*  static/gallery/midjourney/ : has all the pics.
